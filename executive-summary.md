<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ page.image | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>OpenPhone has already established itself as a modern force in business communication, prioritizing user experience. While the platform excels at facilitating these interactions, the rich data generated by users' daily interactions holds even greater potential to inform their workflows and improve their business outcomes. The next strategic leap lies in transforming this wealth of customer interaction data into actionable intelligence. With millions of interactions flowing through OpenPhone, the ability to extract meaningful insights represents a significant opportunity to enhance the product and provide unique value to users. This proposal outlines my vision for the dedicated, newly formed <strong>Insight Squad</strong>, empowered by AI, to provide OpenPhone's customers with invaluable understanding, driving productivity and growth.</p>

<p>My strategy centers on building a scalable data framework and a phased implementation plan to realize this vision. This initiative will focus on delivering intuitive and readily accessible insights that directly empower OpenPhone's customers to manage their communications more effectively, understand their customer interactions better, and ultimately drive greater productivity and success. As a senior technical project manager with hands-on development experience who excels at building high-performing remote teams, driving strategic initiatives, and fostering collaborative environments—particularly within SaaS contexts—I am uniquely positioned to lead the new Insight Squad and establish foundational practices for long-term success.</p>

<p>A core tenet of this initiative is delivering intuitive and readily accessible insights that directly empower OpenPhone's customers. This report site details a commitment to a data-driven approach, continuous improvement, and ultimately, the delivery of tangible value that aligns with OpenPhone's mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.</p>

<p>The strategic thinking and technical leadership outlined in this proposal directly address the requirements of the <strong>Senior Engineering Manager, Insight</strong> role. I am eager to bring my expertise and passion to OpenPhone, leading this critical initiative and contributing to your continued innovation and customer success.</p>
