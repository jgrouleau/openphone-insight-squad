			<h1>Proposed Data Strategy for Customer Insights</h1>

<!-- Content -->

<p><span class="image left rounded"><img src="{{ page.image | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>OpenPhone's data strategy for customer insights centers on the responsible and effective utilization of a wide array of customer data, encompassing call logs, SMS communications, call recordings, workflow-related data, and survey responses. The primary aim is to unlock richer, more actionable analytics, enabling a deeper understanding of customer behavior, the identification of key trends, and ultimately the optimization of business outcomes and customer experiences.</p>
  
<p>A foundational principle of this strategy is a strong commitment to customer privacy. This is manifested in ensuring that users have access only to their own data. Moreover, in the development and training of AI models, I suggest employing techniques such as anonymization and data aggregation. This approach allows OpenPhone to discern broader patterns and insights without compromising the privacy of individual interactions. Underpinning these efforts is the development of a scalable and secure data infrastructure, which will likely leverage and strategically extend OpenPhone's existing robust technical foundation to efficiently handle the increased volume and complexity of data.</p>
