<!-- Content -->
<p><span class="image left rounded"><img src="{{ page.image | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>My vision for customer communication insights involves providing users with actionable intelligence to improve customer experience and operational efficiency. This includes capturing post-interaction feedback (NPS, CSAT), optimizing communication flow (FCR, transfer metrics, call flow analysis), and leveraging AI/NLP for sentiment analysis, live agent guidance, smart summaries, enhanced tagging, and predictive insights. The goal is to move beyond basic analytics to offer proactive and data-driven improvements that can be distributed through customizable notifications and workflow-assignable actions, meeting the user where they are with actionable insights. These features are explored in greater detail in the <a href="{{ ai-features | relative_url }}">AI Features</a> section.</p>
